# CALCIMATE
The Calcimate App is for the Operators find the best platform, value for their Simplicity for basic Calculations. It also helps to find their required Square, Cube and its Square root, cube root, sin ,cos, tan, log 10 of a number.

## Advantages
• Faster Coding and Quick Iteration.
• provides Fast and Feature-rich calculator.
• Boost our Self-belief while performing complex calculation.
• We can perform many scientific calculations in a single go
• Operations such as Square, Cube, Square root, Cube root
• We can also perform trigonometric functions such as sin, cos, tan
• We have included the feature of log10 Calculation
• This application is very useful for students to get all the outputs just by entering a single input.

## Limitations
• In our current project we have included only few Scientific calculations
• It cannot perform operations like permutations and combination, Factorial, Matrix Calculations etc.
• This System cannot do such calculations which requires more than one input.
• This System cannot perform conversions from decimal to binary, octal to hexadecimal etc.
• We cannot give Fractional value as an input instead we have to convert into decimal form.
